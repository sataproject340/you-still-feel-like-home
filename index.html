  <h1>You Still Feel Like Home</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>We met in the quiet of something new<br>
    A spark in the stillness, I never saw you coming through<br>
    You smiled like the sun after endless rain<br>
    And in your arms, I forgot all of my pain</p>

    <p>But love, it tests the strongest souls<br>
    And life, it carves its lines into the roles we hold<br>
    There were moments we unraveled, lost in the dark<br>
    But even then, you carried pieces of my heart</p>

    <p>'Cause no matter the silence, the distance, the fall<br>
    Youâ€™ve always been the name I hear through it all<br>
    In a world that spins and leaves me alone<br>
    Your voice reminds me Iâ€™m not on my own<br>
    We broke, we burned, we begged, we bled<br>
    But somehow you still rest in my head<br>
    Even when we were lost and unknown<br>
    You still, you still feel like home</p>

    <p>There were days I vanished inside my skin<br>
    Sickness stole my light, let the shadows in<br>
    I became someone I could barely trace<br>
    Insecure, afraid, just trying to find my place</p>

    <p>And youâ€”<br>
    You held me 'til your hands began to shake<br>
    When love grew heavy with the weight of all my ache<br>
    They turned their hearts from me, I saw your walls rise<br>
    But even behind them, I caught your eyes</p>

    <p>'Cause no matter the silence, the distance, the fall<br>
    Youâ€™ve always been the name I hear through it all<br>
    In a world that spins and leaves me alone<br>
    Your voice reminds me Iâ€™m not on my own<br>
    We broke, we burned, we begged, we bled<br>
    But somehow you still rest in my head<br>
    Even when we were lost and unknown<br>
    You still, you still feel like home</p>

    <p>And when you came back, like a whisper in the night<br>
    I didnâ€™t need wordsâ€”I just knew it was right<br>
    We chose to forgive, to hold, to stay<br>
    To learn how to love in a gentler way</p>

    <p>So no matter the seasons, the scars, the storms<br>
    Iâ€™ll choose your hands to keep me warm<br>
    Weâ€™re not perfect, but weâ€™ve grown<br>
    And every step has made it known<br>
    That love is not just soft or sweet<br>
    Itâ€™s messy, bold, and incomplete<br>
    But with you, Iâ€™ve always known<br>
    You stillâ€”<br>
    You still feel like home</p>

    <p>So hereâ€™s to you on this day of light<br>
    To every wrong we made feel right<br>
    Iâ€™ve loved you through the highs and lows<br>
    And still, you feel like home</p>
